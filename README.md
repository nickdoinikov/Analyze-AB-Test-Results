### Project Title
***Analyze A/B Test Results***

### Description
This project in the part of the ***"Data Analyst Nanodegree"*** by Udacity. In this Project, I analyzed the results of an _A/B test_ run by an e-commerce website.
The goal of the project is to work through the dataset to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Files used
I used the following files to accomplish the project:
* **README.md** ;
* **ab_data.csv** - database from the e-commerce website ;
* **countries.csv** - user database associated with their corresponding countries
* **Final_Analysis.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook with all the necessary queries and statistical models ;
* **Final_Analysis.html** - the HTML version of the Jupyter notebook ;

### Credits
During the preparation and the submission of the project, **no external source** was used during the submission, except for the source databases, which were provided by the course creators.
Special thanks to the Udacity team for this project and its review!
